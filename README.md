# PAM module for OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant

![Azure AD Compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Azure%20AD-Compatible-blueviolet)

This PAM module authenticates users using [OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant](https://oauth.net/2/device-flow/).  The module communicates with the Authorization Server to obtain user prompt data, attempt to retrieve a user `access_token`, and introspect the obtained token. Since the client module needs to introspect the access token via the Authorization Server introspection endpoint, this endpoint must be implemented on the server side. If the token is valid then the user is authenticated. The module validates the following fields in the Token Information Response:

- `active`: Must be true.
- `username`: The username from the `access_token` must match the requested PAM username. The use of "root" as a remote username is prohibited and and will consistently result in failure.
- `scope`: The scopes must match those requested in the module configuration file. The order of scopes doesn't matter.
- `exp`: The expiration date is compared to the current system date converted to UTC.

Only the `auth` PAM module type is implemented in this repo. The `account` type will consistently return success for testing purposes.

This code relies heavily on two libraries:

- [pam-bindings](https://github.com/Nithe14/pam-rs.git) - My own fork of Rust interface to the PAM framework (See [original crate](https://crates.io/crates/pam-bindings) for more details)
- [oauth2](https://docs.rs/oauth2/latest/oauth2/) - A dedicated, strongly-typed Rust OAuth2 client library

## üîê Azure AD (Microsoft Entra ID) Compatibility

Version **0.3.1-azure** introduces support for **Microsoft Azure AD** (Entra ID) using the **OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Flow** with direct validation of the `id_token` (JWT).This is useful when Azure does not support the introspection endpoint or returns opaque tokens.

### ‚úÖ New Features

- Support for `` as a JWT signed by Azure AD.
- Signature verification using Microsoft **public JWKs**: [https://login.microsoftonline.com/](https://login.microsoftonline.com/)\<tenant\_id>/discovery/v2.0/keys
- Validation of claims: `iss`, `aud`, `exp`.
- Identity extraction from `preferred_username`, `email`, or `sub`.
- Supports **automatic creation of system users** upon successful authentication, if the authenticated user does not already exist on the system
  - If the user does not exist, the module attempts to create it using useradd.
  - The home directory is created at: /home/
  - The default shell is set to: /bin/bash
  - The username is preserved **as-is** from Azure AD (e.g. [john.doe@domain.com](mailto\:john.doe@domain.com))

### ‚öôÔ∏è Example Configuration

```json
{
"client_id": "<your-client-id>",
"client_secret": "<your-client-secret>",
"oauth_auth_url": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant_id>/oauth2/v2.0/authorize",
"oauth_device_url": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant_id>/oauth2/v2.0/devicecode",
"oauth_token_url": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant_id>/oauth2/v2.0/token",
"scope": "openid profile email offline_access",
"tenant_id": "<tenant_id>"
}
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è The tenant_id field is optional, but recommended. If omitted, "common" will be used as the default.

‚ùå You **do not need** to specify the oauth_token_introspect_url.

### üõ†Ô∏è Validation Logic

- The JWT header kid is matched against the public keys retrieved from Microsoft.
- The issuer (iss) must match one of the following formats:
  - [https://sts.windows.net/](https://sts.windows.net/)\<tenant\_id>/
  - [https://login.microsoftonline.com/](https://login.microsoftonline.com/)\<tenant\_id>/v2.0
- The audience (aud) must match your client_id.
- The system username is derived from the following claims, in order:
  1. preferred_username
  2. email
  3. sub (fallback)

### üîí Security Notes

- Make sure your Azure application is configured to issue id_token also for device flow.
- Backend token introspection is not required ‚Äî ideal for federated login via **Office365 / Azure AD**.

## Security Best Practices and Rollback

- If you need to roll back or remove the PAM module, **always keep a root shell open** on another terminal.
  - Remove or comment out `pam_oauth2_device.so` and any related lines from `/etc/pam.d/sshd` and `/etc/pam.d/common-session`.
  - Remove `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security/pam_oauth2_device.so` if desired.
  - Restore your original PAM files from backup if you get locked out.

For secure SSH and PAM configuration, see:

- [OpenSSH Official Manual](https://www.openssh.com/manual.html)
- [Linux-PAM Documentation](https://www.linux-pam.org/Linux-PAM-html/)
- [PAM Security Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/security_guide/sec-pluggable_authentication_modules_pam)

**Warning:**Test all changes on a non-production system first!Misconfiguring PAM may cause system lockout or prevent all logins.

## Quick Setup

You can install and configure the PAM module interactively using a one-liner:

```sh
bash <(curl -fsSL https://github.com/ethiclab/pam_oauth2_device/releases/download/0.3.1-azure/setup_pam_azure.sh)
```

This will prompt you for your Azure credentials and configure the system.

---

## Requirements

- rustc >= 1.81.0
- cargo
- gcc
- libpam-devel
- openssl-devel

```shell
#RPMs
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
dnf install gcc pam-devel openssl-devel

#Debian
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
apt install build-essential libpam-dev libssl-dev
```

## Installation

You can install it with provided RPM:

```shell
wget https://github.com/Nithe14/pam_oauth2_device/releases/download/0.3.0/pam_oauth2_device.so-0.3.0-1.x86_64.rpm
rpm -i pam_oauth2_device.so-0.3.0-1.x86_64.rpm
```

You can use the provided Makefile:

```shell
make all
```

This command will test, build, and install the module. Installation primarily involves copying the compiled `libpam_oauth2_device.so` to the PAM modules path and creating example configurations.

Alternatively, you can test and build it manually:

```shell
cargo test [--release]
cargo build [--release]
```

The module file should then be located at either `target/debug/libpam_oauth2_device.so` or `target/release/libpam_oauth2_device.so`, and it can be copied to the PAM modules path (`/lib64/security/`).

## Configuration

#### Arguments

The module requires a configuration file. You can specify the path to this file using the `config` keyword, as that's how the parser works. Please refer to the example below:

```conf
auth       sufficient   pam_oauth2_device.so config=/etc/pam_oauth2_device/config.json
```

The `config` argument specifies configuration path and is not required, but it is recommended to set up. Otherwise, the default configuration path (`/etc/pam_oauth2_device/config.json`) will be used.

Module also parses two optional arguments:

- `logs`: Specifies the logging path (default: `/tmp/pam_oauth2_device`),
- `log_level`: Specifies the logging level filter (default: `info`). Possible options: `info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`, `trace`, and `none`.

These **cannot** be configured via a configuration file, as logging is initialized beforehand and operates independently of config parsing.

Example:

```conf
auth       sufficient   pam_oauth2_device.so config=/etc/pam_oauth2_device/config.json logs=/var/log/pam_oauth2_device/log log_level=warn
```

#### Config file

The configuration file (`config.json`) must be a valid JSON file with all required fields properly set:

Look at [example-config.json](./example-config.json).

### Redirect URI

The redirect URI is hardcoded as a `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob` value because the PAM module is Out of Band. You need to configure this redirect URI in your OAuth client settings.

## Testing

If you installed the module using the Makefile, you should find a testing utility at `target/pam_test` and an example PAM configuration at `/etc/pam.d/device-flow-auth`. Ensure you create the configuration file at `/etc/pam_oauth2_device/config.json`. You can use the following command to test the module:

```shell
                                 # Just the name of PAM config under /etc/pam.d/. Not a path!
./target/pam_test <pam-username> device-flow-auth
```

Make sure to replace `<pam-username>` with the actual username configured in your system.

## SElinux config

Setting one of this booleans should be sufficient: `authlogin_yubikey` or `nis_enabled`.

```shell
setsebool -P authlogin_yubikey 1
# OR
setsebool -P nis_enabled 1
```

## SSHD example

This `sshd_config`  params are required:

```conf
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
UsePAM yes
```

An example of `/etc/pam.d/sshd`:

```conf
#%PAM-1.0
auth       sufficient   pam_oauth2_device.so config=/etc/pam_oauth2_device/config.json logs=/var/log/pam_oauth2_device/log log_level=info
auth       include      postlogin

#the rest of the file...
```

# Notes

- This module doesn't have built-in LDAP integration, so **users must be present** in the system before they can log in via this module. It works well alongside SSSD.
- This code uses [log](https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/) and [simplelog](https://docs.rs/simplelog/latest/simplelog/) to provide easy logging with a global logger. However, PAM cannot drop this logger properly, which can cause memory leaks. To prevent this, a [shutdown()](https://github.com/Nithe14/pam_oauth2_device/blob/master/src/logger.rs#L64) function is called just before unloading the module. This function flushes the logger buffer and drops the global logger using unsafe code, so please be cautious. It has been tested with Valgrind, and no further memory leaks occur, but remain mindful of this.

**Warning:**Test all changes on a non-production system first!Misconfiguring PAM may cause system lockout or prevent all logins.
